        <p>What is Git?
            Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows developers to collaborate on projects efficiently by managing changes to code files.
            
            Key Features:
            Distributed Architecture: Git uses a distributed model, where every user has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history. This allows for offline work and enables collaboration without a centralized server.
            
            Branching and Merging: Git makes branching and merging simple and lightweight. Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently and merge them back into the main codebase when ready.
            
            Fast Performance: Git is known for its speed and efficiency, even with large repositories. This is due to its use of techniques like delta compression and shallow cloning.
            
            Data Integrity: Every change made to the codebase in Git is checksummed, ensuring the integrity of the repository. This helps prevent data corruption and ensures the reliability of the version history.
            
            Staging Area: Git has a staging area (also known as the index) where changes can be selectively added before committing them to the repository. This allows for precise control over which changes are included in each commit.
            
            Collaboration: Git facilitates collaboration among developers by allowing them to push and pull changes to and from remote repositories. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting for Git repositories, making it easy for teams to work together.
            
            Common Git Commands:
            git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
            git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
            git add: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
            git commit: Records changes to the repository with a message describing the changes.
            git push: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
            git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local repository.
            git merge: Combines changes from different branches into the current branch.
            Git Hosting Platforms:
            GitHub: A web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects. It offers features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.
            GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab provides hosting for Git repositories along with additional features like continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
            Bitbucket: Atlassian's Git repository management solution, offering similar features to GitHub and GitLab.
            Benefits of Git:
            Enables collaboration among developers, even in distributed teams.
            Provides a reliable and efficient way to track changes to code.
            Facilitates code review and quality assurance through features like pull requests.
            Supports branching strategies that enable parallel development and experimentation.
            In summary, Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration in software development, offering a wide range of features and benefits to developers and teams.</p>

        <p>HTML (HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)
            What is HTML?
            HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It provides the structure and content of web pages by using various tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers, which then render the content to display it visually to users. HTML is a fundamental building block of the web and is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.
            
            Purpose
            HTML is primarily used for creating the structure and content of web pages on the World Wide Web. It serves several purposes:
            
            Content Structure: HTML provides a way to organize content on a web page, defining headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other elements.
            
            Semantic Markup: HTML allows web developers to use semantic elements to give meaning to different parts of a webpage, aiding accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
            
            Hyperlinks: HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages or sections within the same page.
            
            Multimedia: HTML supports embedding various types of multimedia content, such as images, videos, and audio files, into web pages.
            
            Forms: HTML includes form elements that enable users to input data, such as text, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons, facilitating interactions with websites.
            
            Responsive Design: HTML, combined with CSS and JavaScript, allows developers to create responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
            
            Example of HTML structure
           <pre>
            <code>
                <html>
            <head>
                <title>My First Web Page</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
            </body>
            </html>
            </code>
           </pre>
        </p>
        <li><a href="lessons/markdown.html">MARKDOWN</a></li>
        <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that has gained widespread popularity for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Originally developed by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown was designed to be an easy-to-write and easy-to-read plain text format that could be converted into HTML and other formats. Over the years, Markdown has become the de facto standard for formatting text on the web, used extensively in documentation, README files, forums, blogs, and other platforms where plain text is commonly used.

            One of Markdown's key strengths is its simplicity. Unlike complex markup languages like HTML, Markdown uses intuitive syntax that is easy to learn and remember. This simplicity makes it accessible to a wide range of users, from developers and technical writers to bloggers and content creators.
            
            Another advantage of Markdown is its portability. Since Markdown documents are plain text files, they can be easily shared, version controlled, and edited using any text editor. This portability makes Markdown an ideal choice for collaborative writing projects and workflows where compatibility and flexibility are essential.
            
            Markdown also offers a rich set of formatting options, allowing users to create headings, lists, links, images, code blocks, and more with minimal effort. Despite its simplicity, Markdown supports advanced features such as tables, footnotes, and metadata, providing enough flexibility to handle a wide range of document types and styles.
            
            Furthermore, Markdown is platform-independent, meaning that Markdown documents can be rendered consistently across different devices, operating systems, and software applications. This ensures that content created in Markdown retains its formatting and structure regardless of where it is viewed or accessed.
            
            In recent years, Markdown has seen widespread adoption in the software development community, particularly for documenting code, APIs, and software projects. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket natively support Markdown, making it the preferred choice for writing project documentation and README files.
            
            Overall, Markdown's simplicity, portability, and versatility have made it a staple format for writing and formatting text on the web, empowering users to create clear, well-structured content with ease.</p>
