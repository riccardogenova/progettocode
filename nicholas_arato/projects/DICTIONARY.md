### Git Terms:

1. **Repository**: A directory or storage space where your projects can live. It can be local to a folder on your computer or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host.

2. **Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files) in a repository.

3. **Branch**: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

4. **Merge**: Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

5. **Pull Request**: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

6. **Remote**: A remote is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. This repository is usually stored on a code hosting service like GitHub.

7. **Clone**: Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of the repository on your computer.

8. **Fork**: A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forks remain connected to the original repository, allowing you to submit pull requests.

9. **Stash**: Stashing temporarily shelves changes that you don't want to commit immediately, allowing you to switch branches without losing your work.

10. **Rebase**: Rebase is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

13. **Tag**: A tag is a label used to mark a specific commit as significant, such as a release version or a milestone.

14. **Reset**: Reset is the act of moving the HEAD and current branch pointer to a specific commit, potentially discarding changes made after that commit.

15. **Submodule**: A submodule is a Git repository embedded within another Git repository. It allows you to include external repositories as part of your project.
