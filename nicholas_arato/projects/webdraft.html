          <strong>GIT (GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER)</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
          <strong>What is GIT?</strong><br>
          Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed for managing projects of all sizes with speed and efficiency. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become one of the most widely used version control systems globally. It enables collaboration among developers, facilitates code management, and ensures the integrity and traceability of project files.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          <strong>Origins</strong><br>
          Git's development was spurred by the limitations and complexities of existing version control systems like CVS and Subversion. Torvalds aimed to create a system that was fast, reliable, and capable of handling the massive scale of Linux kernel development.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          <strong>Use Cases</strong><br>

        <li><a href="lessons/html.html">HTML</a></li>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML (HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)</strong>
      </p>
      
      <p>
          <strong>What is HTML?</strong><br>
          HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It provides the structure and content of web pages by using various tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers, which then render the content to display it visually to users. HTML is a fundamental building block of the web and is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing web pages.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          <strong>Purpose</strong><br>
          HTML is primarily used for creating the structure and content of web pages on the World Wide Web. It serves several purposes:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              <strong>Content Structure:</strong> HTML provides a way to organize content on a web page, defining headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other elements.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Semantic Markup:</strong> HTML allows web developers to use semantic elements to give meaning to different parts of a webpage, aiding accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Hyperlinks:</strong> HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages or sections within the same page.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Multimedia:</strong> HTML supports embedding various types of multimedia content, such as images, videos, and audio files, into web pages.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Forms:</strong> HTML includes form elements that enable users to input data, such as text, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons, facilitating interactions with websites.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> HTML, combined with CSS and JavaScript, allows developers to create responsive web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
          </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
          <strong>Example of HTML structure</strong><br>
          <pre>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
          &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
              &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/html&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>
          <strong>MARKDOWN</strong>
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
          Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for easy readability and simple conversion to other formats like HTML. It was created by John Gruber in 2004, with contributions from Aaron Swartz. The primary motivation behind Markdown was to develop a syntax that is intuitive to write and easy to understand even in its raw form.
